# snakeGame

Run main.py to start the classic snake game.

Try to eat the food displayed on the screen by moving the snake towards it.
This increases the length of the snake by 1 unit (initial length 3 units).
The game is over when the snake hits itself or the walls while moving.
The score is displayed as per how many food items are eaten.

Enjoy!
